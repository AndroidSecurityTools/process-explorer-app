What is it?
===========

Process Explorer enables you to view the processes running on your device and,
in the case of Dalvik-based apps, their corresponding logcat output without
cluttering your device's main display. Instead, Process Explorer runs a
node.js-based process in the background that listens to a socket connection. By
pointing your computer's web browser to that socket on the device -- say using
"adb forward" -- you can see all the processes running in real-time along with
CPU and memory usage graphs. Basic controls allow you to control filtering and
refresh rates.

Process Explorer is also available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opersys.processexplorer).

Installation
============

Required assets
---------------

In order to function, this project needs the following assets found in the
[process-explorer-web](https://github.com/opersys/process-explorer-web) project:

* app/src/main/assets/process-explorer.zip
* app/src/main/assets/process-explorer.zip.md5sum

This application won't function properly without these assets.

Building an APK
---------------

This project uses `gradle` in order to build and package this application.

Simply run the following in the `process-explorer-app` root directory:

> ./gradlew build

And you will find the build artefacts in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

Installing
----------

Use `adb` to install the application in Android:

> adb install app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

Logcat fix
----------

The `READ_LOGS` permission is not automatically granted to applications
even when the application requires it. It needs to be manually granted to the
application right in the shell using the following command:

> adb shell pm grant com.opersys.processexplorer android.permission.READ_LOGS

Using Process Explorer
======================

Once it has been installed on your device, you should simply probably forward
TCP/3000 to be able to browse the nodejs app.

> adb forward tcp:3000 tcp:3000

Then simply browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) !

Note about running as root
--------------------------

You will probably want to run Process Explorer service as root since it will
let you manage the processes on your device / emulator. If you have one of the
"su" apps install, you can simply enable the `Run as root` option.

If you're using the AOSP emulator, run the following on your computer, you will 
have to start the service by hand, running the following on your computer:

> adb shell "cd /data/user/0/com.opersys.processexplorer/files && ./node ./app.js"

This is launching the Process Explorer application with the Node.js daemon.

Without running as root, you won't be able to get process details or send signals
to process.
