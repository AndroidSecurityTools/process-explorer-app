What is it?
===========

Process Explorer enables you to view the processes running on your device and,
in the case of Dalvik-based apps, their corresponding logcat output without
cluttering your device's main display. Instead, Process Explorer runs a
node.js-based process in the background that listens to a socket connection. By
pointing your computer's web browser to that socket on the device -- say using
"adb forward" -- you can see all the processes running in real-time along with
CPU and memory usage graphs. Basic controls allow you to control filtering and
refresh rates.

Process Explorer is also available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opersys.processexplorer).

Installation
============

Generating the required assets
------------------------------

In order to function, this project needs the following assets found in the
[process-explorer-web](https://github.com/opersys/process-explorer-web) project:

* app/src/main/assets/process-explorer.zip
* app/src/main/assets/process-explorer.zip.md5sum

This application won't function properly without these assets.

Building an APK
---------------

This project uses `gradle` in order to build and package this application.

Simply run the following:

    gradlew assemble

And you will find the artefacts in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

Installing
----------

Use `adb` to install the application in Android:

    adb install app/build/outputs/apk/app-release-unsigned.apk

Logcat fix
----------

The `READ_LOGS` permission is not automatically granted to applications
even when the require it. It needs to be manually granted to the
application right in the shell using the following command:

    adb shell pm grant com.opersys.processexplorer android.permission.READ_LOGS

Of course, the device must be connected and accessible through adb
for this command to work.

Using Process Explorer
----------------------

Once it has been installed on your device, simply you should probably forward
TCP/3000 to be able to browse the nodejs app.

    adb forward tcp:3000 tcp:3000

Then simply browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) !
